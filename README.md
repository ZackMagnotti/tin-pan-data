Owner: Zack Magnotti

This is an exploratory data analysis project aimed at a data set containing information on all of the billboard top 200 albums, and the songs in those albums, from 1/5/1963 to 1/19/2019.

The data for this project is too big to upload to github but can be found at https://components.one/datasets/billboard-200.

The documentation for Spotify EchoNest data can be found in the docs folder, or at https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/.
